            <p>
                ☛ Virat Kohli is an Indian international cricketer and the former captain of the Indian national cricket
                team who plays as a right-handed batsman for Royal Challengers Bangalore in the IPL and for the Delhi in
                Indian domestic <br><br>
                ☛ Born:5 November 1988 (age 34 years), New Delhi <br><br>
                ☛ Virat Kohli has won the most ICC awards in history - 9. The biggest achievement in Babar's career is
                to be compared with King Kohli. Detailed highlights of Virat Kohli's 72 against England, Chennai, 2021
                <br><br>
                ☛ Virat, a 13-year-old, is selected for the Delhi Under-15 team for the Polly Umrigar Trophy in October.
                He ends the campaign as Delhi's leading scorer.<br><br>
                ☛ Virat is chosen for the India Under-19 team for the first time after making an impression at the youth
                level for Delhi. He then had a fantastic tour of England, averaging over 100 in the one-day
                series.<br><br>
                ☛ In Malaysia's Under-19 World Cup, Virat led India to win and finished the competition as one of the
                top three run scorers. His innate leadership abilities attracted the proper kind of attention.<br><br>
                ☛ Royal Challengers Bangalore, an IPL team, signs Virat on a youngster contract for just Rs 12.5 lakhs
                when he is still a minor.
                <br><br> ☛ Virat received his maiden call-up to the Indian ODI team and participated in the entire
                five-match series against Sri Lanka on the road. In the fourth game of the series, he hit his first 50,
                a 54-run inning.
                <br><br> ☛ When Virat got his first ODI century against Sri Lanka, 107 off 111, it was worth the wait
                for him to return to the national squad.
                <br><br> ☛ Virat participated in every game of India's victorious World Cup campaign in 2011, scoring
                his only century against Bangladesh in the opening match. Despite the fact that he didn't exactly light
                up the tournament with his bat, his final-round remark to Sachin has since become legendary in cricket:
                "Sachin Tendulkar has carried the weight of the nation for 21 years." Time for us to carry him on our
                shoulders
                <br><br> ☛ Every cricketer will answer "play Test cricket" when asked what their dream is. In 2011,
                Virat finally had the opportunity to play in his first Test match against the West Indies. Unfortunately
                for the charming lad, it was a forgettable experience as he scored just 19 runs in the two innings he
                played.
                <br><br> ☛ In the fourth and final test against Australia in Adelaide, Kohli achieved his first test
                hundred under somewhat dramatic circumstances. He just avoided being run out when batting with Ishant
                Sharma and nearly ran out of partners. However, he was unable to save India. 4-0 was our series loss.
